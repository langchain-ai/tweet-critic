# In-App Prompt Optimizing

In this streamlit demo we'll build a tweet critic that revises and improves our tweets.
You can chat from the app and let it help you craft a better one.

If you dislike an example, leave a 👎 and a comment explaining why you dislike the suggestion.
If you like the example, leave a thumbs up and it will be added to a few-shot example.
If it's close but you want to make modificationsk, modify it in the textbox before smashing that 👍. The modified result will be saved to the dataset.

Over time, the generator learns from your feedback, all via prompting.
